# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
I'm not a big fan of playing games, but I am interested in games that have scenarios and plots. These types of games will keep me engaged and motivated to play at the same time. Part of the reason I wanted to learn GDIM was because I was exposed to big 3A games, such as China's Black Myth Goku, and Assassin's Creed, which was incorporated into the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics, which gave me a superb fusion of culture, art, and plot in gaming. My favorite games are arguably A way out & Overcooked, and I'm taking this class to contribute to the future of 3A gaming, which is a huge honor. I've studied simple games like Super Mario before, but I don't have much real-world experience, so in the future I'd like to be involved in the planning of 3A games, which are similar to RPG that travel through an empty cultural world.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [yes] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)
          ART is oriented towards interaction design, with the ability to design user interfaces and installations.

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
    I hope to learn the basic ideas for designing a game in this class, such as establishing the basic framework of a game world and setting up my own type of game character. In addition to basic scenario planning and plotting, I'd like to gain a deeper understanding of how to write parts of a game engine.

6. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
    In fact, I don't have much programming experience, and I was afraid that I would struggle more than others in the learning process. At the same time, unlike traditional science subjects, this class requires more logic and language skills, for which I also felt some fear and nervousness.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
Know some basic python language
2. Game development (any engine)
0
3. Unity
Can make Mario jump with unity
### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
A document that contains an idea of the outline of the game before the game planning process begins.
2. Scope management
N/A
3. Iteration
Repeat an instruction to achieve a certain goal
4. Object-Oriented programming
N/A
5. Model-View-Controller architecture
   Specific game constructs
